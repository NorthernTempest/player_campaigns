# Poppy Brent's Backstory

Poppy is the name of a brilliant red flower that once grew on a number of worlds. It's also the name of one peculiar android. Poppy Brent was created 50 years ago and adopted by a middle-aged human man named Harker Brent who, instead of treating Poppy like an autonomous robot, treated her as his own daughter.

## Awakening and Apprenticeship

When Poppy first gained consciousness, she was laying in a shoddy bed in a drab apartment in Downlow, inside the Spike on Absalom Station and Harker was sleeping restlessly in a chair next to her. Shifting in the bed, Poppy accidentally disturbed Harker's slumber. Harker woke with a start and, with an expression half surprised and more than half relieved, embraced the android in a warm hug. What ensued was a delicate conversation where Harker carefully skirted the topic of Poppy's origins and reinforced the fact that he was here for her now, no matter what.

Harker led a busy life. He worked as a private detective, landlord, handyman, and a part-time local hero whenever he could afford to be. Adding onto this list of responsibilities, Harker took it upon himself to care for, educate, and provide guidance to Poppy as she grew accustomed to life on the station from inside that cramped one-bedroom apartment with an attached office (Harker usually slept on the couch, unless he came home *particularly* sore after work). Harker was knowledgeable about every scholarly pursuit from literature to the latest discoveries of science, medicine, and magic. What's more, he was particularly apt at teaching, effortlessly guiding Poppy to find interest and skill in every academic topic he could think of.

Of course, academics wasn't the only topic Poppy was interested in. She'd often demand to join her father on his work as an investigator. He would have none of it. He would only tell her "I don't want you to get involved in *my* problems. The skeletons in my closet and the scum that I fight against are for me to deal with. You were born pure and innocent into this world, and I have no intention of letting that change any time soon."

Instead, Harker used diversionary tactics. He had Poppy learn how to cook and bake from old Mrs. Tompkins in the next apartment over, making friends with her two teenage daughters, Samah and Iniga, in the meantime. Harker introduced Poppy to his secretary's disabled husband, Mr. Lingdon, who'd teach her about hardware and software from his computer repair shop. Harker had his mentor, an elderly but spry Miss Iskeer, teach her the basics of self-defense, self-discipline, and practical self-sufficiency. And, of course, he took her out to the Free Markets to expose her to the vast variety of people and cultures on Absalom Station.

Poppy was fascinated by the vibrancy of life at the Free Markets. She saw hawkers shouting above the crowds while pickpockets trawled the underbelly of those same crowds. She saw warriors and heroes celebrating great victories, she saw CEOs and nobles toast financial success, and she saw average office workers looking forward to another quiet evening at home. She saw foods and dyes, technology and magic, books and holovids. She saw arguments, protests, discussions, rumormongering, and whispers. She witnessed happiness, fear, sadness, and anger. Essentially, she saw every walk of life aboard Absalom Station from in that market.

## Questions and Queries

This period of gradual progress, learning everything that Harker and those he trusted could teach her, lasted twelve years. As an eager and intelligent student, Poppy avidly absorbed every piece of information that she could. Over the course of those years, Poppy slowly grew more and more aware that some great trouble ate away at her father. He would slink off into the night while she rested and return home battered, bruised, and bleeding. At times, he would start at the smallest of things. At others, he would be too exhausted to react when Poppy called out to him as loud as she could.

Whenever Poppy brought up these worries, Harker would calmly reassure her but skillfully dance around any questions she had about his problems. He would assure her that he had everything under control and that she was in no danger. He would tell her when he was involved in some incident on the news, but never what he was doing there to begin with. However, Poppy was a clever girl. She knew that, if she couldn't wrestle an answer out of her father, she could follow the clues and figure it out for herself. She started by questioning Harker's confidants.

Miss Iskeer responded to the questions only by *heavily* increasing the intensity of Poppy's combat training. Mrs. Lingdon stared at Poppy with an inscrutable but intense expression and flatly told Poppy to drop the subject. Mrs. Tompkins, on the other hand, was surprisingly receptive to Poppy's questions, although her understanding of the situation was limited. She quietly explained one night that Harker was engaged in some kind of conflict with a large criminal organization known as the Veeno Family and that Poppy was somehow at the heart of their conflict. Also at the heart of the conflict was Harker's departed fiancé, Zatara, who Mrs. Tompkins learned had passed away a few months before meeting Poppy. She was also able to explain that, although she didn't fully understand the situation, Harker had hinted that things were getting worse, but that he had finally identified the Veeno Family's main hideout and was planning one final assault.

Poppy, of course, wouldn't let him go into the den of the beast alone. She kept close tabs on her father's movements over the following days. When Harker went out without her, she'd trace his route as far as she could through the public surveillance systems she had infiltrated. When he'd type up his case notes at his desk, she would listen attentively for any thoughts whispered aloud. When they sat down for dinner, she would surreptitiously press him for any hint of a clue. None of these routes of investigation led anywhere. Her father was as careful as ever.

## Fears and Fallbacks

Ultimately, it was Harker himself that would unravel the issue before Poppy. One Sixthday, in the middle of dinner, Harker passed Poppy a hefty manilla envelope. "Don't open that. Not right now. I'm going somewhere tonight and no, you can't follow. Everything's accounted for and my plan is already in motion. I should tell you that I know that you've been asking about me. I know that... you've been worried for me. I'm sorry for making you worry. As your father, it's *my* job to worry over *you*, not the other way around. I appreciate your concern, I do, but I can assure you now that everything is going to be alright by tomorrow morning. However... you know me. I need to have backup plans in case things go awry. If, in 7 days, you don't hear from me, open the envelope. You'd be well looked after."

Poppy was already in tears. She understood exactly what was happening. She knew exactly what he was saying. "Poppy. You don't need to worry. I have every contingency accounted for. You have no idea how long I've been working towards this. You have no idea how important what I'm doing tonight is.... Damn it!"

Harker, ever the stoic, was tearing up and beads of water were streaming down his cheeks in response to his daughter's worries and fears. He wiped his face, fought back the tears, and pushed through what he had to say, "This envelope is *only* for the least likely case that I can't make it back. You *really* don't have to worry about me. I'll be back here in the morning, I promise. Let's... let's just eat."

Poppy, in a rush of emotions, stood up from the table, took her plate of food, ran into her room, slammed the door closed behind her, and locked the door, tears streaming down her face as she did so. She ate silently, crying through the whole meal, but with a look of determination on her face. She then began her preparations. Armor, concealable laser pistol, extra batteries, knife, comm unit, hacking tools. Everything she needed, she had been slowly gathering for the past few weeks. She unlocked the door and pulled on the handle. It wouldn't budge. She tried the window. *It* wouldn't budge. She was locked in.

## Pain and Push

She was losing time. She was falling behind her father. Poppy slammed the butt of the knife into the window. It shattered. She knocked the broken glass out of the way and climbed out onto the emergency escape stairway. Grey android blood slowly streamed down her leg from a small gash close to her left knee. It didn't matter. She rushed down the stairs, but spotted a problem as soon as she got to the bottommost landing. Old Miss Iskeer was gazing up at Poppy from the ground. She held a baton in her hands and was standing ready to use it. "Dear, you turn around right now. I know you *think* you know what's best, but you're only 12 years old. Leave all this to the adults. This is your father's problem to face, not yours."

Poppy took a running jump, hoping to land past Miss Iskeer so that she wouldn't have to fight the old lady. You may think that was for said old lady's benefit but, in reality, Poppy had never bested the wry old lady in a practice match, except by outrunning her bum leg. Poppy landed harder than she expected on her scratched leg and came down on her knees. Quick as a whip, Miss Iskeer's baton cracked against the android's skull. Poppy was seeing stars already. She picked up faster than she thought she could and she ran. Miss Iskeer swiped again but only hit air and swore, "Fuck!" as Poppy ducked under the blow and quickly ran out of Miss Iskeer's reach. As Poppy rounded the corner, Miss Iskeer hobbling behind, she muttered under her breath "Harker, you can't leave a job like this to an old lady like me!... Oh dear. She's really gotten away now. I suppose I can only hope that I've been a better teacher than a prison guard."

Far behind Poppy, and out of her sight, the old lady went to her knees, out of breath. A pained expression suddenly crossed her face and she clutched her chest. "Damn it!" she cried, "I need to see the end of this!"

She tossed her baton at the one lit window on this side of the apartment building, cracking the glass and drawing Samah Tompkins' attention inside. The old woman let loose a breath of air and collapsed, seeing no more. Samah already had her comm unit in hand and was dialing to report the incident. She ran downstairs to the crumpled old woman's side.

Ahead, Poppy was running at full sprint. She already knew which way her father had gone based on which directions he had taken the last few days, but she needed to catch up to him before the point where she always lost him. She ran and ran, trying to access the city's cameras while she sped along. He was almost at the dead zone. No! He was running faster than she could keep up! He must have used a potion! He was already at the edge of the last camera's range... and then... he was gone.

## Search and Sound

Poppy kept running. If she was quick, she could try to find her father's tracks and follow them. She arrived at the last camera. After searching for a while, she determined she was out of luck. He had covered his tracks for at least a block. She found a pair of shoes and some discarded clothes. He was in disguise, an old school disguise, just like him. She couldn't track him from the public cameras if she didn't know what he looked like. Her only hope was that there was a witness. It wasn't that late, but the streets were empty. She was solidly in the Spike now and most buildings stood abandoned. In desperation, she came up with an appropriately desperate idea. "Anyone who saw where the old man who changed clothes went," she screamed at the top of lungs, "Has 50 credits waiting for them here if they spill it!"

It was a stupid idea. No one would have spotted him. Her father was far too careful for that. A man suddenly stepped out of the shadows beside Poppy. Surprised, she let out a gasp, but quickly realized her stroke of luck. She was surprised by him! If she hadn't seen this man covered in trash and hiding in the dark, then there's every chance he hadn't either. "Which way?!" Poppy demanded.

"That way," the man grumbled through a voice that sounded like it had barely spoken in a month, "Guy was faking a limp and wearing a dark red shirt, blue jeans, brown jacket. He went that way. Always does. Never sees me. Where's my creds?"

Poppy handed him her cred chip with fourty-seven credits on it, nodded her thanks, and started sprinting after her father. She had lost several minutes searching the alley and dealing with the homeless man. She was behind, too far behind. She pulled up every camera she could find down the way her father had went, searching for the man who matched the homeless man's description. She immediately found him. Quietly and slinking in the shadows, she slowly followed in her father's footsteps, checking every camera she passed to make sure she was didn't miss him turn.

She was making progress, but it was slow. She was moving much slower than her father. She was at least 20 minutes behind him at this point. Then she heard an explosion and then another. It didn't sound far off. Dread filled her to the very brim. She started ignoring the cameras. Whatever was happening, it was where the explosions were. She followed her ears, darting from darkness to darkness. From her place hidden in the shadows, she saw a cargo transport peel away, moving at an incredible speed. She kept the pace and kept to the dark.

She turned the corner and saw a factory ablaze in fire and light. Two massive gas tanks, engulfed in flames, had blown apart. The fire was intense. It must have been burning for 15 minutes. She didn't see him. Her eyes passed over crumbling cinderblocks and broken windows, over the paved driveway, over the sheds and nearby warehouses all burning to the ground. He wasn't there. Wait. As the door to the central building in the compound folded open, she saw the silhouettes of two men.

## Fire and Failure

One of the two silhouettes was thin and quick. The other was bulky and fierce. She rushed forward. The two clashed. Sparks flew! Magical and alchemical sparks both! She sprinted ahead faster than she ever had before. They were so far away! "FATHERRR!!!" she shouted, her lungs already hoarse from crying.

The thin shadow in the flames turned briefly to look at her. The bulky frame stretched out a hand and loosed a blast of magic. The thin frame ducked to the side, but not quick enough. The small frame was carried back by the concussive blast. "NOOOO!!!" she shouted louder.

Then the thin frame was up and fighting again. Harker was fighting again. Relief washed over her. She ran again, ignoring the shadows, chasing only her father. As she approached, she could begin to see the frames of their faces. All was awash in red. From the flames or from blood, she could not tell. She sprinted harder and harder. They were so far away. A thousand feet away or further. The fire blazed. The heat, even at this distance was almost more than she could handle. Blows were traded. Harker struck the shadow then the mysterious shadow struck him. The fight was too even. It could go either way.

She ran for what felt like forever. The fight went on. She heard the sharp crack of a firearm and her leg suddenly roared with pain. She crashed painfully into the ground. Her attention separated from the fight ahead of her to search for where the gunshot had come from. A rifleman, no a rifle*wo*man stepped out of the doorway of a warehouse just to her right. A cruel laugh echoed over the roar of the flames. "If you don't want your girl to die, drop your weapons and surrender" called out the woman.

She had a crazed look on her face. She practically screamed the words, seemingly more banshee than human. Her rifle was the only thing that stayed steady, keeping it expertly trained on Poppy as she laughed maniacally. The fight in the building ahead came to a halt. Poppy aghast at her mistake in coming here, cried out "NO!!! DON'T LISTEN TO HER, FATHER!!!"

Too late. Harker limply dropped his gun to the ground. "NOOOOO!!!" cried Poppy again.

Harker lifted his hands up. They moved behind his head. A head that... *should* be hanging low in defeat. Through the firelight Poppy could still see the defiant tilt in Harker's chin. He wasn't defeated yet! Boom! The building to Poppy's right exploded. The corrugated sheet metal walls bowed outward and then burst like a balloon. The fireball engulfed the woman and flew out fourty feet from the doorway. She screamed in pain. A death wail, probably. Meanwhile, the remnants of the warehouse became shrapnel and flew out in every direction. The stocky man who was fighting Poppy's father just moments ago let loose another spell, only to have one large chunk of the warehouse fly through where his heart should be. His body crumpled to the floor... as did Harker. A chunk of concrete flew into Poppy's head, and she knew no more.

## Reawakened and Requests

Poppy regained consciousness with a start and sat bolt upright with a scream. The hospital staff around her jumped with fright. She was in the emergency ward. Poppy's mind raced for a few seconds then called out "Hello?"

A young man raced to her side, a nurse, she supposed. He looked her up and down "Hello! You seem to be doing well! Glad to see it, but if you could lay back down-"

"No, that's not important! Where is my father? Where is Harker Brent?"

The nurse looked at the android girl in the eyes and frowned. He seemed to consider whether to address her question and then responded "There were a few people caught up in that inferno you were found next to. We're still trying to identify one other survivor, but there are at least a dozen dead. If your father was caught up in whatever happened last night, chances are he didn't come out."

"Where is the survivor?" Poppy asked, no, gently demanded.

"They're in the intensive burn unit. You can't go see them cause it's a clean room. And even if you did, they would be unrecognizable."

"How tall are they?"

The nurse paused and stared deeper into the android's eyes, trying to search within them for whether it was okay for him to say. "Five foot four inches."

Far too short to have been Harker. Perhaps the girl who had shot at Poppy from the warehouse.

"That's not him."

There was a long pause. "I'm sorry."

"It's possible he got away."

"That *may* be true. I recommend you wait to see the police first. They may ask you to identify the bodies."

The police came. They came with pictures. One of those pictures was of the hefty man. He seemed older than Poppy had imagined him. Another of the pictures was of the dead body of her father. She cried and didn't stop for half an hour.

## Recovery and Review

Poppy was dismissed from the hospital the next day, her injured legs, minor burns, and significant concussion now healed. She took the opportunity to head home, where she learned that Miss Iskeer had passed away that same night from a heart attack. What's more, Samah had disappeared and the other Tompkins women were grieving. Mrs. Lingdon came in a few days later to hand in her notice of resignation. Poppy properly paid her the generous dismissal package her father had promised his assistant. Then Mrs. Tompkins said she was moving away. They all consoled her, but then... they left her alone.

Poppy tried to learn more about the investigation into the events of that night. She learned from the inspectors she was interviewed by that a significant amount of drugs and alchemical goods had been either destroyed in the fire or seized by the authorities. There were secret rooms in the basement with large quantities of credits stowed in locked safes. The whole building had been burned through. Whatever illegal operation was going on there was finished.

Poppy identified the woman in the burn unit as her attacker after she had undergone reconstructive work. The police charged her with assault, coercion, and complicity with Barker's murder. All of it eventually stuck, and she received 35 years in prison followed by life on parole. That was almost as bad as the scars across her body that she received in the warehouse explosion.

The investigators were concerned by only one thing. The cargo transport that had escaped that night may have gotten away with who knows how many criminals or illegal goods. They never found out where it went though. Poppy hadn't been able to catch the vehicle's license plate. That puzzle, even Poppy had no clue how to solve.

## Missions and Missives

The next week of her life was mostly filled with mourning her father and mentor. Over one afternoon, she busied herself with fixing her window and removing the screws that had held it shut, but that was over quickly and without trouble. With the spare time she had now been cursed with, she tried her best to learn more about her father. The key, she thought, was in his case notes. She spent many hours slowly and carefully navigating the complex security precautions implemented by her father. It took her five days. When she was finally able to break into the file system and read the first case note, she found it encoded. Not encrypted, not truly, but encoded in such dense reference numbers and shorthand that decoding the contents would be like trying to untangle a crumpled cobweb. She realized it would take years of research to unlock these secrets but she resolved herself to see it through.

It wasn't until two weeks had passed that she even dared to look at the envelope she had been given the night of her father's death. In her heart, she hoped that this was all a part of her father's plan and he would show up one day with a smile and return to Poppy's life. Of course that didn't happen. He had promised to see her again the next morning, and to open the envelope if *one* week passed without seeing him. She already knew he was gone anyway. She had seen the body and seen the ashes come out of the crematorium. No body double could be so perfect, including even the scars, and no pretending could have saved him from the furnace. Regardless, it was now time for his final fallback plan to reveal itself. She cut open the envelope.

Inside the manilla envelope were three documents. First, a sealed, signed, and witnessed last will and testament. Second, a sealed letter to a Reverend Aulk Trellum. Poppy noted the address on the letter to the Reverend. Not very far away. The final document was an unsealed letter addressed to Poppy.

> Dear Poppy,
>
> If you are reading this at least one week after I have disappeared, I am either dead or unable to meet you again for the foreseeable future, as I'm sure you have guessed. That does not, however, mean that all hope is lost. Below, I have disclosed my final plan and reasoning for it in case all things go awry.
>
> Enclosed is a letter to a Reverend Aulk Trellum, who is an old friend I've never had the opportunity to introduce you to. Your first step is to ask that Aulk attempt to resurrect me. Included in the envelope to him is enough credits and a piece of my body big enough to perform a resurrection. If I am dead and my soul is free to return, I will be sure to come back when called. You are my final fail-safe to ensure this is done.
>
> If, however, either my soul is bound and unable to return or I am alive but for unexpected reasons unable to return for the foreseeable future, I have enclosed a copy of my final will and testament. The notary I used is trustworthy. I have not known her long, but she has my full respect, and I have hers. In case the resurrection fails, have her disclose the will. I'll spoil it a little now. You will get nearly everything, except some small debts I owe to a few friends.
>
> I am sorry Poppy, either way, for making you face such hardships. I never intended to make trouble for you, my beloved daughter.
>
> Harker Brent

## Prayers and Payments

Poppy had sat up straight at the possibility of having her father resurrected. She hurriedly finished the rest of the letter to be thorough, but jumped to action immediately after reading her father's apology at the bottom of the page. Poppy snatched up the letter to the Reverend, quickly but carefully collected the urn of ashes she had resting beside her father's computer in case those would prove of use, and began running down the apartment stairs. Minutes later, she was gasping out of breath at the front door of the address listed on the envelope for the Reverend. It was a simple commercial unit in an old mostly abandoned plaza. The only sign that it was a church was the symbol of Pharasma hanging next to the door and a small nameplate in even smaller font that read "Church of Beloved Souls, Reverend Aulk Trellum"

Poppy burst in the door, finding the surprisingly large space mostly empty. Some pews sat facing a podium and one old fashioned upright piano. One door led to another space and on the door was a sign saying "Reverend's Quarters"

Poppy ran to the door to his quarters and knocked as hard as she could. She heard movement from within and a surprisingly young sounding voice called out "One moment please!"

After a half minute passed, the door quietly opened from within and a handsome elf, smiling, stood there. "What can I do for you?"

"Reverend Aulk?" Poppy confirmed.

"I am he," the Reverend responded, "are you seeking guid-"

Shoving the letter into his hand, Poppy interrupted with "Harker Brent. This letter is from Harker Brent. I was told you know him."

The elf, a little taken aback by the urgency the android was displaying, paused for a half of a moment then gently took the letter from Poppy's hands. "Come in."

The elf stood aside and invited Poppy into his quarters. A small dining table for two sat next to a kitchenette. A computer desk and a lounge chair were cramped together in the far corner of the room. There were no windows, and everything in the apartment could be seen from the front door except the bathroom and the bedroom. It was even smaller than the apartment that Poppy and Harker shared. Aulk pulled out the chair for Poppy to sit down. She did. Aulk fetched a knife from the kitchen and stood over the table while he carefully sliced open the letter. The cred chip fell out onto the worn table surface, then a black vial, then a letter. Poppy stared hard at the elven cleric, then glanced at the page. Only one line was written there: "Plan Z, Aulk. Thanks!"

Aulk sighed, picked up the chip and walked to his computer. He checked the creds on the chip and said "It's all here. I'll be back. I need to collect the material components. In the meantime, there's tea in the cupboard and a kettle. I'm going to lock up while I'm gone, so please don't leave."

20 minutes passed while Poppy waited, tea in hand then in stomach. Poppy heard the door to the street unlock, open, then close. She stood up, but before she could say a word, Aulk was at the door to his quarters and was already indicating she should sit down again. "This spell will take eight hours to cast," He explained, "If you could, would you please bring me food and drink when I need it?"

"Yes," she nodded, "anything else?"

"No. Thank you, dear."

The Reverend stood and walked to his bedroom door with the urn and the vial. He pulled a pouch of gemstones out of his pocket. "See you at eighteen o'clock then," he said dryly, "Oh. And I *am* sorry for your loss. I knew Brent for many years but haven't met with him in some time. If you ever have need for anything, come to me."

She nodded again. The elf closed the door behind him. Poppy heard him begin incanting the spell on the other side. She waited patiently, and waited, and waited. She began cooking dinner around half past sixteen o'clock, a little too early for the Reverend's requested eighteen o'clock serving time. That meal was served around seventeen thirty, and Aulk accepted it gratefully. She couldn't rest that night as she rested in the adjacent room.

Around twenty-three o'clock, the chanting from Aulk's room stopped as did the sound of shifting magic. Poppy sat upright, at rapt attention to the handle of the door. When the knob rotated and Aulk's head appeared, frowned, then gently shook, Poppy felt a weight in her chest drop into the pit of her stomach. She covered her face, expecting to cry again, but nothing came. After a moment, she slowly lowered her arms, revealing her face now entirely devoid of emotion. She quietly thanked Reverend Aulk for his time and effort. He apologized once again for her loss, handed her her father's ashes, and left.

## Meetings and Morbidity

The next day, she searched for and called up the notary that had witnessed the will and testament, one Mrs. Bierra Parcier, and made an appointment to have the testament's reading witnessed the a few days later. In the meantime, Poppy found herself unable to smile or laugh or even cry. This should have worried her but she couldn't put together the willpower to find that emotion either. She barely slept, more so closing her eyes and wishing for time to pass.

She arrived at the office of the notary an hour and a half early with the will in hand, came in, checked in with the assistant at the desk, and sat down. Two minutes later, Poppy was admitted to Mrs. Parcier's office. The human woman was young. Perhaps nineteen years old. She wore a fine suit and her office was sparsely but finely and neatly decorated. "Come in and sit down, please," requested the notary, "We will begin once the others have arrived."

Poppy was mildly confused. "The others?"

"The will is to be read in front of yourself, Mrs. Poppy Brent, Mr. Aulk Trellum, Mr. Mickey Karndt, Mrs. Rosella Mitra, Mr. Nikk-Nakk, and myself, Mrs. Bierra Parcier. Three copies of the will and testament were made. One for Mr. Harker Brent, which I assume he entrusted with you prior to his death, one he left in the care of my office, and one he left in the care of Nikk-Nakk, a young starfinder. I would prefer not to discuss business until the others arrive. Would you like some tea?"

Poppy had to ask herself that. Her lips were parched. She couldn't remember the last time she drank anything. "Could you please bring me some water?" she asked.

"Of course."

The notary stood and left her desk. In one corner of the room, she had a stand with a tray of snacks and several types of drinks. She took a cup from inside a drawer and filled it with water from a water cooler next to that stand. She sighed. "I knew your father and worked with him on occasion. It is deeply regrettable that he has passed away."

Bierra brought the cup of water to Poppy's side. "You seem... harrowed... Mrs. Brent. Am I right in believing that you were there the night of the incident?"

Poppy's dead eyes briefly sprung to life, piercing into Mrs. Parcier's face like a memory piercing into the past. Poppy was suddenly there again that night. She was witnessing Harker's body collapse to the floor... "Sorry! I... I didn't mean to make you relive that, Mrs. Brent. I just meant to ask whether... I don't know... was there any closure to his passing? Did they catch his killer?"

The image of that mysterious, bulky mage who worked for the Veeno family immediately came to Poppy's mind. "They found his killer's dead body," the android responded, "but, whatever was happening there, at least a few people managed to get away."

"Oh," the Notary let out, disappointment in her tone, "sorry."

The two sat in silence for several minutes. The waiting was awkward and silent. The silence was awkward and draining. Eventually, the four other parties to the reading slowly trickled in, ending with Nikk-Nakk, who arrived twenty minutes early. Bierra placed a microphone on her desk and started recording.

"Since all parties are present we shall proceed with reading the will and testament of Mr. Harker Brent ahead of schedule. Please state your names for the record."

The 6 people in the room each stated their name, one after another. Poppy wasn't paying attention. She wanted to know what Harker's last will was and what his final words to her were meant to be.

"Let the record show that Harker Brent is reported to have died around twenty minutes after midnight pact standard time on..." her voice trailed off as she searched for the date.

"The sixteenth of Neth," Poppy filled in.

"Right. The sixteenth of Neth two-eighty-one, and we have gathered here eighteen days later on the fourth of Kuthona two-eighty-one. We will now proceed with the reading. Poppy, Nikk-Nakk, please open your packages, and I will open mine."

The three of them quickly broke open their individual manilla envelopes and pulled out their contents. In addition to a stack of papers, fifteen sealed letters fell onto the conference table around which everyone was sitting. They seemed to be three copies of each of five different letters addressed 'To the Reverend', 'To the Armourer', 'To the Kid', 'To the Financier', and 'To Poppy'.

## Debts and Despair

See [Last Will and Testament of Harker Brent](poppy-brent-last-will-and-testament-of-harker-brent.md) for the full document.

Bierra started reading from the stack of papers aloud. At first, the document went over the necessary affirmation that Harker *willingly* wrote the will and testament and then there was a section about paying out any expenses incurred by Harker's death and paying any taxes incurred. Poppy was trying her best to pay attention through the reading without jumping ahead, but everything so far had been basic legal pre-ramble. She was glad that the expenses were handled at least.

The document continued by naming Bierra Parcier the executor of Harker's will but also mentioned that, if Bierra was unwilling or unable to complete the duty, that Poppy would be in charge of that role. Being called on as a backup executor surprised Poppy to a degree. Until then, she had expected that Harker had thought of Poppy as a child, not someone who could be expected to manage his will after his passing.

Then the document began listing beneficiaries and which items they would receive.

> To Reverend Aulk Trellum, currently of the Downlow on Absalom Station, my close confidant, ally, and brother-in-law in another better life, I bequeath:

Poppy's eyes were drawn to the elven Reverend she had met only a few days prior. She recalled hearing from Mrs. Tompkins that Zatara was her father's fiancé and that she had passed away in some way because of the Veeno family. She supposed that that was something the two of them shared now.

>To Rosella Mitra, currently of the Ring on Absalom Station, my investment partner and life-long friend, I bequeath:
>
> - the 479 credits I owe her from various projects,
> - a copy of my list of contacts,
> - 20% ownership of Brent Properties ltd. along with 20% ownership of all its assets and profits, including the Spirewind Heights apartment complex,
> - 100% ownership of Brent Chemical Supply ltd. along with ownership of all its assets and profits,
> - and 100% ownership of Brent Detective Agency ltd. along with ownership of all its assets and profits, and
> - all copies of the letter addressed "To the Financier"

Poppy suddenly realized that she recognized the name Mitra, as well as the person attached to it. She had been introduced to Ms. Mitra years ago when Harker had been remortgaging the apartment complex. Ms. Mitra was a financial advisor and a friend of Harker's. Poppy, at the time, had wondered if the two of them weren't involved romantically. Now, Rosella's expression was set in stone and it was set to grim. She looked like she was holding back a lot of frustration. When the stern looking lady suddenly snatched at the nearest letter with the label "To the Financier", and tore it open, Poppy suddenly realized that the woman's eyes were unusually wet and tears were already beginning to stream down her face. She began to read the letter in the middle of the reading of the will and testament.

Everyone around her paused, likely in surprise. As she read the first few lines she began to bawl openly, even gasping for air. Bierra stood and fetched the woman a drink from the stand in the corner of the room. It was several minutes until everything was calm again. Poppy noticed that Aulk had picked up one of his own letters but not opened it. His usually solemn eyes were moist as well. At least he didn't start reading it too. Poppy, meanwhile, retained the same empty expression she had sported since last meeting the elven Reverend and she looked on these events with dispassion and almost disinterest.

Bierra spoke into the microphone, "we will be taking a short break. We will return in 30 minutes."

## Loss and Love

Over the break, Rosella disappeared into the washroom, finished reading her letter, and cleaned herself up. She returned to the meeting wearing less makeup but otherwise wearing the same dour expression she had initially brandished when she came in. Her eyes still shone wet with tears, and she stared questioningly at Poppy, averting her eyes when Poppy looked to meet them.

Bierra reinitiated proceedings, "our break has finished. It is now fourteen-thirty-five of the same day. We are recommencing the reading of the will and testament."

> To Mickey Karndt, currently of the Downlow on Absalom Station, my arms dealer and drinking buddy, I bequeath:
>
> - My collection of firearms, alchemical weapons, armour, and shields, except for one firearm and one piece of armour of Poppy's choice,
> - 26 credits I owe him for covering my tab, and
> - all copies of the letter addressed "To the Armourer"

"Damn! That'll be *something* alright!" Mickey said under his breath. A painfully sharp stare from half the eyes in the room kept him from saying any more. Poppy had never met Mickey, and she wasn't immediately inclined to know him better after that statement. Mr. Karndt picked up his letters and proceedings continued.

> To Nikk-Nakk, currently of Little Akiton on Absalom Station, my adventuring mentee, I bequeath:
>
> - 500 credits,
> - my copy of "Socioeconomic Equality In Review", and
> - all copies of the letter addressed "To the Kid"

Poppy had seen Nikk-Nakk around too. Harker would often be pestered by the little adventurer, but never seemed to mind. The ysoki was dressed in mechanic's clothes, rather than armor or clothing more suited for action. Poppy considered the small scruffy creature. She decided that if Harker found it worth investing 500 credits into the young ysoki, she would believe in and hope for his success too. Nikk-Nakk collected the letters with addressed "To the Kid"

> To Poppy Brent, currently of the Downlow on Absalom Station, my beloved daughter, I bequeath:
>
> - The remainder of my credits, bonds, shares, and other financial assets,
> - 80% ownership of Brent Properties, ltd. along with 80% ownership of all its assets and profits, including the Spirewind Heights apartment complex,
> - one firearm of her choice from my collection of firearms,
> - one piece of armour of her choice from my collection of armour,
> - The remainder of my personal assets, and
> - all copies of the letter addressed "To Poppy"

Poppy immediately recognized the value of what Harker had left for her. Harker had earned a substantial sum over the years working as an adventurer. He didn't choose to live in Downlow because of the low cost of living. He was there because he knew he could do the most good there. Poppy picked up the letter addressed to her. She stared intently at the letter. She must know what Harker had to say to her. She couldn't help losing track of things around her as she began to consider what might be inside.

Before Poppy realized, Nikk-Nakk and Bierra put down their copies of the will and testament. The reading was done, then? Poppy lowered her own papers to show that she was paying attention. Bierra looked around the room, seemingly to gauge the state of the beneficiaries. Her eyes eventually landed on Poppy. "Before we end the meeting, there is one matter that I must elaborate on. As executor, I have taken stock of Harker's assets in preparation for today. Between stock shares, bonds, creds, and physical assets, as far as I am aware, Harker's total worth at the time of his death was thirty-two-thousand seven-hundred-and-twenty-two creds"

Poppy didn't react. The number was within her expectations, albeit a little higher than her estimate. "Excluding the amounts listed under the other beneficiaries, the amount comes to thirty-one-thousand five-hundred-and-sixty-seven. I will be taking two-hundred-eighteen credits for my fees and expenses, leaving you with thirty-one-thousand-three-hundred-and-fourty-nine credits. I recommend you invest it wisely."

"Yes," Poppy responded, "of course."

Eyes shifted to Poppy. All the eyes in the room. Poppy should have felt uncomfortable but couldn't work up the smallest amount of discomfort. Rather than face the eyes though, she turned to the letter she grasped. She tore it open. Before she even started reading, her eyes were a blurry mess. For the first time since she learned of the resurrection's failure, she could feel again. It was awful timing. She burst out in tears, wiped them away, managed to read a word or two, and then her eyes would go blurry again. She knew the others must be watching, perhaps judging her, but she couldn't stop herself.

> My dear Poppy,
>
> I love you. These past twelve years have been filled with more happiness than I could have ever imagined. In a time where I lost Zatara, my heart felt empty like the void. When you came, you filled my heart back up to the brim. Since you came into this world, you have been my purpose for being
> 
> I'm sorry. I've failed you by not coming back. And this mistake is the one I can't fix, recompense, or properly apologize for. I imagine you are hurt and I cannot be there to comfort you. I owe you many times over what I was able to leave you in my will, and I doubt that a single credit mattered.
>
> You must have a lot of questions. For a man whose profession was to find the truth and fight for justice, I have held back too much of the truth from you and thereby done you great injustice. There are two things about you that I had always intended to tell you when the time was right but never had the opportunity to say.
> 
> First, Zatara, my fiancée, was the woman who designed, created, and named you. She died protecting you and your designs from the Veeno family by exploding the foundry in which you were built, dying in the process. Since then, the Veeno family has been after the two of us, and I have been protecting you with the best of my ability.
> 
> Second, when you were initially created, you were designed to be a highly capable weapon. Zatara had intended to use you to break up the gangs in the Spike and have you act as a guardian for the civilians there. It seems that, shortly before her death, she chose to reprogram you to be more independent and to choose your path for yourself.
> 
> I will leave you with this final lesson from my grave. If you are to follow in my footsteps as a detective or a chemist, there are two essential tools in your locker. First, the evidence will tell you the truth, the whole absolute truth, if you observe it carefully and ignore the noise around you. Second, always have a plan. Having a plan is the first step on your path to success. Without one, improvising becomes harder, no matter how good you are at it.
> 
> In times of trouble, feel free to rely on the people I have left my will to, in addition to the people I had teach you. Each one of them is reliable and a close friend, even if some of them are a little estranged to me at the moment. I should think that my death won't change that. In my letters to them, I have asked them to support you where they can, and I believe they will do so.
>
> I love you, Poppy, and I'm sorry. Please go on to achieve your dreams, whatever they might be. Remember those lessons I was able to impart to you. I'm sure that you'll live through a great number of troubles but with your skills, you'll find a way to survive. More than anything, Poppy, I hope you find happiness and success in any path you choose in life.
> 
> Harker Brent, loving father

Poppy leaned back into her chair. She had stopped crying half way through reading the letter but she felt exhausted, drained from her burst of emotions. Everyone around her was looking at her in silence. Her gaze moved across the room, meeting the eyes of each person one after another.

"I'm sorry. I- I don't know what to do now," Poppy managed to get out, "What am I meant to do now?"

The room burst into chatter, as the others began going over their thoughts. Poppy felt a sense of ease, putting her faith in her father's trusted friends. It felt like he was guiding her still even past the end of his life. Exhaustion and sleep took her as she suddenly realized how comfy the chair she was slouching in was.

## Sleep and Solidarity

The people gathered at this meeting were all true friends of Harker's. While Poppy was reading her letter, each had read their own and the words that Harker had left them had moved each of them to action. They realized that Poppy was aimless and hurting and in need of people to support her. As she slept silently in seat, the others confirmed each others' agreement with Harker's last request to them.

After they came to agree on that, they started to ask each other what they knew of the secretive Harker and his android daughter. It wasn't much. Each of them knew bits and pieces of Harker. All of them had heard from him about the existence of a daughter, but none, save Aulk, had ever met her, and even then, not until just days ago. They all agreed that Harker's death came at a great surprise and that each were surprised that Harker hadn't asked for their help in his final battle.

Harker's final request to look after Poppy made sense from the dead man's perspective, of course, but why did he bring together this strange collection of people to bring it about? Each of them was now in significant debt towards Harker after the things he had given them. The copy of The Bones Land in a Spiral that Harker had left Aulk was a rare copy originally from Golarion, and had been dated to within 50 years of 4050 AR, some 1000 years or so before the end of the Gap. The investments that Rosella had received were worth many times the amount that she had initially lent him to realize them. Mickey knew that Harker's collection of weapons was unmatched and worth a small fortune. Nikk-Nakk, having received more credits than he had ever known, was no less speechless at the gesture.

They each had skills that Harker had recognized, of course. Aulk was a talented cleric and spellcaster. Rosella was a quick-witted and wealthy day-trader. Mickey was a capable weapon smith. Nikk-Nakk was making waves in the Starfinder Society as a mechanic. But none of them were especially good at caring for an android woman they had never met.

After a few hours spent discussing, Poppy woke up to the sound of raised voices. The four other inheritors and Bierra were arguing about whether Poppy was an adult or a child. When Poppy's eyes opened, and looked at them all, they each felt a little silly.

Since the hour was getting a little late and most people were feeling hungry after everything that had happened, Rosella suggested they move the discussion to a restaurant. Everyone agreed, and moved to a private hole in the wall that Bierra knew. There, the group grilled Poppy on everything they could think of. What had happened to Harker? How old was Poppy? What had Harker taught Poppy? Why had Mrs. Tompkins and Mrs. Lingdon left? What had happened to the indomitable Miss Isreek? They spent hours trying to gather what information they could. Poppy was happy to have everyone concerned about her and to be able to talk about her problems with people she could trust.

Eventually, the restaurant started to close down for the night, and they determined it was for the best if they would rest for the night and come back to the problem tomorrow, agreeing to meet at the same restaurant when it opened late the next morning. Poppy barely slept that night, but eagerly arrived at the restaurant a half hour early. She arrived surprised to find that all the others had beaten her to the meeting. After another long day of talking, exchanging notes, and eating together, they came to only one conclusion.

Poppy hadn't been caring for herself. She was suffering from a significant amount of emotional distress and needed someone to help her look after her immediate needs. None of the people gathered there were able to pick up and move and none of them were able to move in with Poppy for the time being. Nikk-Nakk, however, mentioned that he had a cousin who was looking for a place to stay in the Downlow and was looking for work. Someone he trusted and was close with.

After another long day of discussion, the most they could come up with was that Poppy should meet with this cousin of Nikk-Nakk's and see if they would be a good roommate. They all exchanged contact information and agreed to keep in touch. From then on, each of them would call on Poppy about once a week and would be reliable contacts whenever she got in trouble.

The next day, Poppy showered, ate, and sat alone in her apartment. The walls seemed empty and unwelcoming without Harker or anyone to share them with. She took up the time by solidifying plans to meet with Plonk, Nikk-Nakk's cousin. They decided to meet up at a nearby restaurant and make their way to the apartment complex if they hit it off. Poppy drifted off to sleep uneasily, the dead empty walls seeming to mock her the entire time.
