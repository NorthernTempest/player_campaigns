# About Roktor's Oaths:

Forbidden Knowledge: Roktor once tried rebelling against his adoptive parents, and read a book called 'The Prince' written by someone named 'Machiavelli'.

Oath of Abstention: When Roktor absorbed the powers of a rock, he became unable to eat or drink, like rocks are incapable of eating and drinking.

Oath of Candor: Roktor doesn't understand how to form a lie (maybe it's some form of mental disability.)

Oath of the Cryptkeeper: All the goblins that ever raised him died and their bodies were left to rot in the ruins they inhabited. He had to kill off some monsters that were attracted by (or created from) the goblins' corpses. He swore that he would properly dispose of any bodies he came across in the future.

Oath of Humility: Nobody's willing to follow him cause he's ugly and hard to understand.

Oath of Ignorance: Roktor grew up in a goblin household and was taught that written words steal the words from your head. Furthermore, the one time he tried reading, he started to experience unreasonable paranoia.
