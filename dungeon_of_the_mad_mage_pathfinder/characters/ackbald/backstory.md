# Ackbald the Enkindler
**A Tale Written for Quiet Hatchlings**

This story serves as the backstory for Ackbald the Enkindler.

## Books Speak Volumes but it's Heroes that Hold Your Heart

You stride quickly down Bookstack Way, tracing your tail childishly through the gravel and straining your eyes to catch a glimpse of your destination. You struggle to avoid your excitement leaking out like trying to keep a lid on a vial of impact foam after it's been shaken too hard. As a well maintained limestone brick wall barely comes into the range of your darkvision, you unconsciously break into a light jog. The sign above the door is remarkably well made and well maintained. The name of the building is carved clearly in Draconic on the stained wooden sign: 'Cymrelaak Dragon Memorial Library'. The doors that stand below the sign are as grand as any other building in the valley. You push gently on the doors and they swing smoothly on well oiled hinges. A bell chimes as you step in, though you don't know where from.

As you enter a humbly furnished foyer, you can smell alchemical glue, old leather, dried ink, and dusty ancient paper. The air is warm and dry, perhaps magically so, and unusually still for an enclosed underground structure. The dim balls of reddish light in the wall sconces are clearly magical in nature. The only occupants of this room, other than you, are one long desk at kobold height and a set of simple benches. That makes sense. The librarian's assistant wouldn't be here this early. Several hallways and one descending stairway lead away from the small foyer, but only the stairs leads into the stacks. All other paths lead to the conservatory or to private reading rooms.

You've been here before but never before opening. You wonder quietly to yourself where the other kobolds might be. You wonder where the esteemed master librarian Ackbald might be. Three of your senior schoolmates are due to work with you today but, because it's your first day, you won't see them for an hour or so yet. The silence of the library is surprisingly warm and gentle. It completely lacks the paranoia that kobolds have when alone in unfamiliar territory. Perhaps Ackbald enchanted the building with a sense of calm. From nearby, you catch the gentle sound of a page flipping. You crook your neck to hear the sound again. The quiet clatter of a tea cup on a saucer breaks the silence.

The sound is coming from down the hallway to your right. You immediately rush through the archway with a beaming smile on your face that you're completely unaware of. After remembering to hop over the enchanted harpoon traps and stumbling over the command word to pass the dragon statues, you rush along the granite tiles to the source of the noise. "Mr. Ackbald! Mr. Ackbald!" you call out "I'm here early just like I said!"

As you round the corner, you catch a ray of light peaking through a crack in a door, just barely ajar. You hear the teacup and saucer clatter as they're gently placed down. You come up to the door and push it slightly more open to peek inside. On the other side of the door is a cozy little kitchen and sitting room, probably a breakroom for the library's handful of employees. Sitting in a wheelchair by the fireplace is a kobold with verdigris scales and swathed in simple robes. He's taller than you thought he would be, but... so thin. It's all you can think when you see him now, properly for the first time. It shouldn't be possible to move with such thin limbs and you can almost see even the shape of his ribcage through his loose robes.

Still, this wasting creature before you is one of the oldest, most famous, and even, dare you say, one of the most dangerous kobolds in the world. His story and that of the nameless volunteer emancipation force he led is legendary. Ackbald isn't technically a member of the Cymrelaak clan, but only by the very strictest definition. Very few have worked as hard as him for the benefit of the clan and he. Perhaps none have, since he was old and immortal even while the city still stood.

"Hello there young one, it's a great pleasure to work with you. Before we-," he stops as you accidentally interrupt him with a half spoken word. "Sorry. What's that you said?" he asks.

You explain to him through hurried breaths that you are so incredibly excited to be working with the famous 'Ackbald the Enkindler'. The grizzled kobold smiles abashedly. "Oh no, the stories are very much exaggerated, my child. Certainly, I've lived a storied life. I am, after all, old enough to have known Cymrelaak for some several years,"

He turns gently away from you and his eyes alight upon a dearly rendered statuette of a dream dragon that sits above the fireplace. He continues, "But no, I am not all so great as the rumor mill suggests. I am a mere miniscule kobold, just as you. If you were to devote yourself to study as much as I, I'm sure you would achieve just as much, if not more. Come, let's begin your training."

## Pondering, Pontificating, and Potatoes

It has been a number of months since you've started your training at the Memorial Library. It's such a fascinating job. Sometimes lectures are held here. Sometimes art pieces are put up in the larger halls. But more so than anything else, your days are filled with looking after the innumerable documents that get sent here. More come in every day. Most of the books that come in are extremely old. Where other libraries in the valley might stock the latest discoveries in engineering and arcana, Ackbald seems to spend his time and resources preserving old documents. Everything is taken in and everything is preserved. From forgotten scientific theses to blueprints of lost structures, even tax documents and civil records. Personally, you've come to think that he's probably uniquely qualified since he's one of the few people alive that can remember that these books and papers even exist in the first place.

Sometimes you forget exactly how old Ackbald is. He still has his original birth certificate. He showed it off as part of a joke at a dinner party. Something about sentimental old people and inevitable decay. What's it like living in a head that's over a thousand years old? What's it like having seen generations of drow come and go? Why did he keep fighting them for a thousand years? He wasn't ever even a resident of the city, just a visitor who left a few days beforehand...

"...Hey! You listening?"

"AH!"

You nearly jump out of your scales. Bliztgam raps her knuckles on the top of your head. "You good?"

You blink three times before responding, "Oh, just thinking about... Ackbald."

Blitzgam gives you a weird look. Then she shrugs and says "That's fair. There's a lot to think about there, I guess. Still, he's just some nice old man, right?"

You nod your head vigorously, but ironically. "Some nice old man who's forgotten more in his immortal lifetime than I'll ever know in mine!"

The red scaled kobold in front of you gives a deep chortling laugh. She wipes away a fleck of spittle and plays along with "Nah! He never forgets anything! I bet he remembers the inside of his egg!"

A joke it may be, or an exaggeration, but you almost wouldn't put it past him to actually remember from before he hatched. A chill runs down your spine as you imagine it.

"Oh yeah! I was calling out to you-," Blitzgam begins.

"Sorry," you interject.

"Quit it! I was calling out to you cause Ackbald wanted to chat with you over lunch."

You wrinkle your brow ridge. "What? Why?"

Blitzgam shrugs. "I dunno."

Little kobold new employee panic enters your voice. "Did I do something wrong?!"

"I dunno!"

You're still the newest trainee. Why would the boss waste his time talking with you? Those usually quiet anxieties whisper wild worries in your head. Still, Ackbald has never been quick to anger, just quick to correct. You shake your head to get the anxieties out. "Okay. Sure."

"Cool."

"When's lunch?"

With as straight an expression as anyone has ever given you, she says "Was supposed to be 31 minutes ago."

"Whuh?" you respond.

Blitzgam shrugs. You dash past her. You hear cackling, nigh howling, coming from behind you as you exit the room. You add a mental tally mark to your mental list. You reconsider. You add three mental tally marks to your mental list.

Luckily, the hallways of Cymrelaak Dragon Memorial are never overly crowded. You sprint your way from the larger work room to the break room, hoping he's still there. Of course, you slow down around the really irreplaceable stuff. The workroom you came from is way in the back, dug out of the cavern wall. You pass by an assistant librarian whose name you don't know yet and a courier who demands that *you* have to be the one to sign for this package or they'll leave, they swear to god. After you give a brief and half-hearted rebuttal, they turn to leave with the package, you give up and agree, sign for the package, and carry it with you as you rush to your unexpected meeting.

After rounding a couple more corners, and passing through the door to the break room, you see Ackbald, sitting in his wheelchair by the fireplace and watching the doorway. He catches sight of you and waves you over. "Hungry?" he asks as you approach.

"I.. uh..." you stumble out. You hadn't considered whether you actually wanted to eat or not. With perfect timing, your stomach grumbles like a clich√©d joke in a satire. "Sure."

A broad smile spreads across his face as Ackbald gives a deep and gentile laugh. "Young one, you appear to be . You know, this is the fourth time I've talked to you in person. Each time, you've seemed particularly anxious. Am I really that frightening? I swear that I'm no danger to you. Even if you make a faux pas of some sort, the worst someone in my corporeal state would be capable of is granting you a stern lecture. And if you think that I'm somehow more important than you, you should know that I think the very opposite. I lecture here so that you and all the new generations of the clan can take over when I'm gone. It might seem a bit cruel, but it's an old person's job to get out of the way when young people are needed and to provide whatever help they can when asked."

"I mean, yeah, but..."
